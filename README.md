# corr_analysis
This repository contains the code and data used for our submission to *Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene*. The Markdown is blinded per the journal's submission requirements and will be moved to a permanent GitHub once the paper is accepted.

The repository consists of the following:  
  - Our [Mixed_Data_Full.RData](Mixed_Data_Full.RData), which is our data file used in the analysis.  
  - A [RPE-Strength_Corr_Final.Rmd](RPE-Strength_Corr_Final.Rmd) which contains our detailed R Code and the obtained results which we describe in detail in our manuscript.
